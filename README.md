# GearMetric-Lab
Automated Gear Efficiency Analyzer – STEM Learning Toy
📌 Project Overview

GearMetric Lab is an interactive STEM toy designed to teach gear ratios, rotational motion, and mechanical efficiency through real-time measurement. Students assemble gear combinations and instantly observe how motion changes using embedded sensors and live digital feedback.

This project transforms abstract mechanical theory into hands-on experimentation.

🎯 Objectives

Visualize gear ratio in real time

Encourage experiential STEM learning

Bridge theory and physical mechanics

Develop problem-solving through experimentation

⚙️ How It Works

User installs a gear combination

Motor rotates the gear train

Sensors detect input and output RPM

Arduino processes rotation data

System calculates gear ratio

Results appear live on the display

Students learn by swapping gears and observing instant feedback.
